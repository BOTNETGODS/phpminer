# phpminer
A pure PHP miner for CryptoNight


Based on https://github.com/shift-reality/php-crypto ,Thanks to @Bogdan

<h2>it's not finished yet</h2>
<br/>
The project's almost done, Incredibly cryptonight() produces 27 seconds a hash.So the hashrate is 0.03H/s.<br/>
I have known that the bottleheck is that php doesn't fit to calculate and mem access so frequently.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this project can achieve at lease 1H/s.<br/>
So there are some possible solutions:<br/>
①Waiting for Just-In-Time of PHP8.<br/>
②make an extension of cryptonight algo.<br/>
<br/>
and I will keep moving till this project reach the expectation.<br/>
